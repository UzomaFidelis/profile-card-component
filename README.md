## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I most useful thing I learned working on this challenge is positining and sizing background images. This was also the first time I applied the knowledge I got reading about css flexbox in positioning elements in a css chellenge. I also learned and used css variables.

### Continued development

I definitely need to learn more about working with background images in css. Don't think I quite have all the important details on that down.

### Useful resources

- [W3schools css background image positioning reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-position.php) - This helped me with the knowledge to position the background image behind the profile card in this challenge.
